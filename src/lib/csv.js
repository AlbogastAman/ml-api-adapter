/**
 * Notes:
 *  - I have done it this way to make the JSON flattening and to CSV as generic as possible. As long as you use a list of JSON objects, the below code will work.
 *  - The other option is to use the json2csv component to handle the conversion, where one can stipulate the mapping directly in the options. This will work, but it will no longer be generic.
